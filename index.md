Hello! I'm a Quantum Computing PhD student at the University of Maryland. Currently, I'm thinking about bridging the incredible theory we have in quantum algorithms with applications - in particular, solving PDE's on quantum computers - I enjoy discussing any aspect of this/ reviewing papers on this topic - so hit me up for either!
